# CarBot Picovoice Wake Word Integration Setup Guide

This guide covers the complete setup and usage of the real Picovoice wake word detection system in CarBot.

## üéØ Overview

CarBot now uses **real Picovoice SDK** with the actual `Hello-My-car_en_android_v3_0_0.ppn` model for wake word detection. This provides:

- **Real wake word detection** using trained "Hello My Car" model
- **Car environment optimization** for road noise and microphone settings
- **Secure access key management** with encrypted storage
- **Direct integration** with StandaloneVoiceService for seamless voice commands
- **Robust error handling** for model loading and permissions

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Picovoice Access Key
- **Get a free access key** from [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
- Sign up for a free account (includes 20,000 wake word detections per month)
- Copy your access key for configuration

### 2. Wake Word Model
- ‚úÖ **Already included**: `Hello-My-car_en_android_v3_0_0.ppn` model is in `android/app/src/main/assets/`
- This is a custom-trained model for the phrase "Hello My Car"

### 3. Android Development Environment
- Android Studio with SDK 29+
- Connected Android device or emulator
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

## üîß Configuration

### Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended for Development)
```bash
export PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY='your_actual_access_key_here'
```

### Method 2: System Property
```bash
# When running the app
-Dpicovoice.access.key=your_actual_access_key_here
```

### Method 3: Programmatic Configuration
```java
PicovoiceConfig config = new PicovoiceConfig(context);
config.setAccessKey("your_actual_access_key_here");
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install and Test
```bash
# Make the test script executable and run it
chmod +x test-picovoice-integration.sh
./test-picovoice-integration.sh
```

### 2. Manual Build and Install
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### 3. Grant Permissions
```bash
adb shell pm grant com.aicarbot.app.debug android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
adb shell pm grant com.aicarbot.app.debug android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
```

### 4. Start the App
```bash
adb shell am start -n com.aicarbot.app.debug/.MainActivity
```

## üé§ Usage

### Wake Word Detection
1. **Start the app** - Wake word detection begins automatically
2. **Say "Hello My Car"** clearly and naturally
3. **Wait for response** - The app should acknowledge detection
4. **Speak your command** - Voice recognition starts immediately after wake word
5. **Receive AI response** - The app processes and responds via TTS

### Expected Behavior
```
User: "Hello My Car"
App: [Wake word detected - starts listening]
User: "What's the weather?"
App: [Processes command and speaks response]
```

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Real-time Logs
```bash
adb logcat -s "CarWakeWordService:*" "PicovoiceConfig:*" "StandaloneVoiceService:*"
```

### Key Log Messages

#### ‚úÖ Success Messages
```
CarWakeWordService: Picovoice wake word detection initialized successfully
CarWakeWordService: Picovoice detected 'Hello My Car'! Detection #1
CarWakeWordService: Voice recognition started after wake word detection
```

#### ‚ùå Error Messages and Solutions

| Error Message | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| `Invalid Picovoice access key` | Configure valid access key from console.picovoice.ai |
| `Failed to copy wake word model` | Check if .ppn file exists in assets directory |
| `Audio permission denied` | Grant microphone permission to the app |
| `Picovoice initialization failed` | Check access key and model file integrity |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Car Environment Optimizations

### Audio Optimizations Applied
- **Noise suppression** enabled for road noise
- **Echo cancellation** for car speakers
- **Auto gain control** for consistent microphone levels
- **Higher sensitivity** (0.8) for car environment
- **Optimized detection cooldown** (1.5 seconds) to prevent false triggers

### Microphone Settings
- **Audio source**: Voice recognition optimized
- **Frame length**: 1024 samples for car audio processing
- **Warmup delay**: 500ms to allow car microphone stabilization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CarWakeWordService**
   - Real Picovoice SDK integration
   - Asset model management
   - Car audio optimizations
   - Service binding with StandaloneVoiceService

2. **PicovoiceConfig**
   - Secure access key storage
   - Multiple configuration methods
   - Encrypted preferences support

3. **StandaloneVoiceService**
   - Voice recognition after wake word
   - On-device AI processing
   - TTS response generation

### Integration Flow
```
Wake Word Detected ‚Üí Service Binding ‚Üí Voice Recognition ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí TTS Response
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Sensitivity Tuning
```java
// In CarWakeWordService.java
private static final float CAR_SENSITIVITY = 0.8f; // Adjust 0.0-1.0
```

### Detection Cooldown
```java
// In CarWakeWordService.java  
private static final int CAR_DETECTION_COOLDOWN = 1500; // Milliseconds
```

### Road Noise Threshold
```java
// In CarWakeWordService.java
private static final float ROAD_NOISE_THRESHOLD = 0.3f; // Adjust 0.0-1.0
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Key Storage
- Keys are stored in **EncryptedSharedPreferences**
- Fallback to regular SharedPreferences if encryption fails
- Environment variables supported for development
- **Never commit access keys** to version control

### Permissions
