## 🎪 How to Deploy Your Agent Team

```bash
# Core Development Team (Use these FIRST)
claude "Use the ai-engineer agent to optimize our voice processing pipeline"
claude "Get the mobile-developer agent to fix Android Auto integration"
claude "Have the backend-architect review our Node.js API structure"
claude "Ask the security-auditor to audit our voice data handling"

# Product Development (Use when core is stable)
claude "Let the performance-engineer optimize our response latency"
claude "Get the test-automator to create comprehensive voice tests"

# Go-to-Market (Use for product launch)
claude "Have the business-analyst create our go-to-market strategy"
claude "Get the api-documenter to create developer documentation"
```
