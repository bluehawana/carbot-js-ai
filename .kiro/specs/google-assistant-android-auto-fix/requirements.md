# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue where Google Assistant in Android Auto starts with greetings but fails to respond to user input (greetings and questions). The system needs to properly handle voice input processing, maintain conversation flow, and ensure reliable communication between the CarBot application and Android Auto's voice services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a driver using Android Auto, I want Google Assistant to respond to my voice commands and questions after the initial greeting, so that I can have a functional voice interaction while driving safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates Google Assistant in Android Auto THEN the system SHALL provide an initial greeting
2. WHEN the user speaks a greeting or question after the initial greeting THEN the system SHALL process the audio input
3. WHEN audio input is processed THEN the system SHALL provide an appropriate voice response
4. WHEN there is a communication failure THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt recovery
5. IF the microphone input is not detected THEN the system SHALL indicate the issue to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to diagnose voice input processing issues in the Android Auto integration, so that I can identify where the communication breakdown occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is received THEN the system SHALL log the audio processing status
2. WHEN the AI provider is called THEN the system SHALL log the request and response
3. WHEN Android Auto services are accessed THEN the system SHALL log the service connection status
4. IF any service fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for all voice interaction steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice interaction to handle various types of input (greetings, questions, commands), so that I can have natural conversations with the assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user says a greeting like "hello" or "hi" THEN the system SHALL respond with an appropriate greeting
2. WHEN the user asks a question THEN the system SHALL process the question and provide a relevant answer
3. WHEN the user gives a command THEN the system SHALL execute the command or explain why it cannot
4. WHEN the user input is unclear THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification
5. IF the system cannot process the input THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper integration between CarBot services and Android Auto voice services, so that voice interactions work reliably in the automotive environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CarBot service starts THEN it SHALL properly register with Android Auto voice services
2. WHEN Android Auto requests voice processing THEN CarBot SHALL handle the request within 3 seconds
3. WHEN voice processing completes THEN the response SHALL be delivered through the correct Android Auto audio channel
4. IF the Android Auto connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
5. WHEN the car system changes state THEN voice services SHALL adapt appropriately
